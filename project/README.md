## Usage

When lunched the application will show you the landing page or index page whatever you call it, In this index page there are three links to two different route the third one is just a placeholder and does not go anywhere so back to the two important links the registration link and the login link the login page will only login the user that his or her information is already in the database and redirect them to their various search page or profile if registered as a professional. The registration route simply render a form with some curple of inputs in which the user must fill to continue to the rest of the page in this page you will have to choose whether to be registered as a professional or a client. Choosing professional will redirect you to the page called upload where you will be prompted for image and image info which will be used as your profile picture, then on submit of the image form you will be promted whit another form this time it will be a long one cause it going to be the info in your profile. One thing to notice in the confirm page cause that what it's called, is that there are inputs like skills,experience,educational_background and certifications that you are going to be prompted to enter a number of the amount of input field to be generated for you because there are no specific amount of skills or experience a person is expected to have which is why you have to decide for your self. but be careful cause the value of the number you entered will be used to do the validation in the backend so be careful not to delete after inputing the number. After that you will be redirected to your profile there you will find links to the route available to you which are the update profile link,the change picture link, the delete account link which actualy does what it means and lastly the message link which allow you to view what ever message was sent to you and you can log out with the log out link and that's all for the professional part. Now for the clients or users that registered as a client after registration you will be directed to the search route where you can search for any professional in the database either by name, description, or job type, In the results presented to you are buttons to view the copy of the professional profile and even message them to contact each other.
